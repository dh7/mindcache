# MindCache Project Rules

## Specification Document

Always refer to `mindcache_3.0_spec.md` as the source of truth for MindCache 3.0 architecture, decisions, and implementation details.

When making changes that affect:
- Architecture or tech stack
- Data models
- API design
- Package structure
- Core features or workflows
- Authentication or sharing model

**Update `mindcache_3.0_spec.md`** to reflect those changes and increment the version number in the changelog.

## GIT
NEVER COMMIT WITHOUT MY CONSCENT. I'LL COMMIT MYSELF.
